## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

This is the second project I've used tailwind. I feel like I've become much more proficient and can now do a lot of things really quickly (This was my fastest project btw)

### Continued development

I still find it very difficult to work with a grid, especially now using Tailwind. I should improve this for future projects.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - First of all, I want to make it clear that I don't let AI do my job. I use it as if I were a senior dev, and I can answer questions like "How to use xyz in Tailwind" or "My body isn't scrolling. What do you think can be done?". Artificial intelligence is an extremely powerful tool when used well. If you don't want it to replace your work, don't take the first step.
